# FairyTaleDB

A blockchain based database built for the AI agent world, with [Project Dark Horse loyalty points](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15QVPOq2H7ttWvvoPEMGkZZbLPgxBSjMhmrr39xWVwLY) as its native currency, while keeping the RBI and Indian govt norms for virtual digital assets in mind. While I would like to keep this database country-agnostic, Indian regulation is the first one I am wanting to work with.

North Star: This gets adapted by one of the top 3 private sector banks in India, fingers crossed :)

## Motivation

My experience working with the banking ecosystem of India is that people there either don't understand crypto very well, or even if they do, they see it as a speculative asset class, not something that has true economic value. FairyTaleDB aims to challenge both those assumptions, by offering all parties in the nation state banking world, starting from India, be it banks or central banks, to see the value of having a public owned blockchain, which is built with constitutional regulations built into it.

## Future Vision

I aim for this to be a publicly hosted blockchain, with nodes doing "useful work" with whatever they are good at: storage, GPU compute or CPU compute, to start with. The wallet creation will be a frictionless process, but when one wants to withdraw money from that as a fiat currency, we follow the taxationn norms of the specific country. We will stay cooperative with the respective govt post the identification of the tax-residency of any wallet but not before, since the wallet holder could be in a place that govt does not have jurisdiction in.
