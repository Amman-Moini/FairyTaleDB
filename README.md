# FairyTaleDB

A blockchain based database built for the AI agent world, with [Project Dark Horse loyalty points](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15QVPOq2H7ttWvvoPEMGkZZbLPgxBSjMhmrr39xWVwLY) as its native currency, while keeping the RBI and Indian govt norms for virtual digital assets in mind. While I would like to keep this database country-agnostic, Indian regulation is the first one I am wanting to work with.

North Star: This gets adapted by one of the top 3 private sector banks in India, fingers crossed :)

## Motivation

My experience working with the banking ecosystem of India is that people there either don't understand crypto very well, or even if they do, they see it as a speculative asset class, not something that has true economic value. FairyTaleDB aims to challenge both those assumptions, by offering all parties in the nation state banking world, starting from India, be it banks or central banks, to see the value of having a public owned blockchain, which is built with constitutional regulations built into it.
