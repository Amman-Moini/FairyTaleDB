# The world's simplest blockchain

Author: Mayank Rajani

## Abstract

The world's simplest NFT as of 5th Nov, 2024 is a SHA-512. Given a SHA-512, it is intractable to compute the original file. I used this insight to build the world's simplest blockchain.

## Details

Let's define a function y=f(x) such that x is a SHA-512 hash, and y is a human-readable text file that makes sense. Since the function f cannot be expressed in the form of any CPU or GPU based program as of today that is tractable, it'll have to be a mix, and the mix will have to be executed on a cluster of machines, ideally machines that come together for a common purpose: religion... no wait sorry, money.

Let's say that we are able to make enough people believe that they will get money in exchange to do the job of finding the answer to this intractable problem, people will either start manufacturing hardware, or start building software that cracks this problem, OR they can just not try to "reason", and use "knowledge" instead.

The future of making money is simple: generate a random series of human readable text, store it in a plaintext file, and take a sha512 using a CLI utility that will be present on the most primitive hardware of the world. Now when anyone on the internet asks "what is the text file for sha512 XYZ" and you are in luck, ie, you accidentally created a file in the past for which the SHA-512 was XYZ; just go ahead and say "I have it and I will take money to give you that file". The real skill in this world becomes coming up with those text files that are "important", ie, they mean something to someone.

Now what do you do to find what data is valuable? Simple! You leave it to the free market. In this paper, I am defining [Project Dark Horse loyalty points](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15QVPOq2H7ttWvvoPEMGkZZbLPgxBSjMhmrr39xWVwLY) as the basic currency to buy and sell these SHA-512 non-fungible-tokens.

(Notice how I used a Google sheet: this is because I consider Google to be an amazing company where the employees asked the leadership to not work with the US govt for ML in weaponry, and the Google leadership complied. Hats off to the democratic culture there!)

Now this file is going to be committed by me to the [FairyTaleDB GitHub repo](https://github.com/mkrjn99/FairyTaleDB), because, why not! Microsoft has also done a lot of good for me and other third-world-country citizens, by letting me use pirated Windows for years. Here's my payback :)

I will also be submitting a file along with this in the repo which will contain the SHA-512 of this file. I want the value of this file to be $1B bare minimum, though not right away, I am okay to wait like 12 years, according to the discussion I had with Sudhir Rao of Celesta VC (awesome guy, highly recommended to talk to).

Why GitHub? Because it is publicly hosted and it's free to submit files on it, thanks Microsoft again! And also because I want to build (or rather should I say I have already built?) the FairyTaleDB blockchain on top of the Git protocol.

Lol, I am an applied math & theoretical computer science enthusiast. I do not read research papers; I mostly just look up stuff online and build stuff on top of other stuff.

Biggest acknowledgement for the last 1 year: ChatGPT. Before that: Google, Wikipedia, pretty much the entire internet. Special thanks to Vitalik Buterin and Prasanna Sankar whose words opened my eyes to see the crypto world for what it actually is: the world of "truth" and "proofs", something that is very lacking in the society I have been a part of since childhood.

Linus Torvalds obviously deserves a lot of the credit: man, you created Git _and_ Linux? Legend bruh! I was a big fan of you and I was pretty sad when you were pushed out by leftist folks regarding your _behavior issues_, but ironically, I had a manager with bad behaviour last year, so I could understand your opposers' point of view as well. Still, big fan; your invention will make me rich, I have "faith".

Hari Om!
