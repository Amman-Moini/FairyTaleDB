# Money is nothing

Starting 1st June 2024, my HDFC bank account has a net outgo of ~53 lakhs, apart from the investments and EMIs for my house. To put it in perspective of how alarming this amount is, it is greater than the amount I have spent between 12-Feb 2018 to 31st May 2024. Have I gone batshit crazy? No! It is because I realised that to make big money, one needs to spend big.

## Types of spending

1. Employee payments: I have not formed any private limited yet, just acting like a sole proprietor, paying people to work for me in various capacities, primarily in the software engineer and founders' office capacities.
2. Food, rent, leisure
3. Loans to others: I have given out loans of over 20 lakhs and nobody has defaulted to date, making my track record better than pretty much any bank in the world, albeit on a small scale.

## Why?

I am building Project Dark Horse, which was started with one simple insight: the unit of worth of anything isn't money. Time has more value than money.

On the way of building Project Dark Horse, I had various realisations, some for the first time, some recurring ones. But one of the biggest ones is: the only two scarce commodities in the world are: time and energy. When you are using a computer, especially large AI models today, you are trading away energy of the universe to conserve your life's time. When you are sitting and thinking, you are trading off your time to save the universe's energy. Both have quite a lot of value, but as of today, there is no machine that has enough "intelligence per unit watt" as your brain has. The development of AGI is a step towards having an intelligence which can generalise truths across domains, but it is highly unlikely that it will be more energy efficient than the human brain in the first version.

Humans have value, dogs have value, pretty much anything that exists in nature has value. Money has no value, it is just a score that the universe has given you, corresponding to what it estimates you have achieved and what you can achieve in the future. If you believe you can achieve anything, you have infinite value; don't let money stop you.
