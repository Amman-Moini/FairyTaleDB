# Important announcement regarding stipends

There have been multiple announcements regarding taking Google forms and other processes regarding people's payments/stipends/salaries more seriously. We have realised that a bunch of people did not take part in these processes and are suddenly waking up close to the last day requesting for their payments, which has caused a sudden cash squeeze.

As a result, announcing this temporary measure:
Starting 10th Nov 2024, any payments promised till 19th Nov 2024 can be potentially delayed by upto 10 days. We have been as transparent with our processes as we possibly can, but without everyone's cooperation, it is not possible anymore.

I would request everyone to take announcements on the PDH internal channel more seriously from now on, thanks for reading till the end!
