# Important announcement

I hope that the layoffs at Sharan Hegde's company makes people realise how bad the situation is: guy has 3M+ subscribers on Youtube and still can't afford to keep paying recurring salaries. My entire insight started from here: the time that a company spends interviewing folks is the time I save in the form of promising people money in advance for their effort. I take more risk than a normal business takes when hiring, expecting higher reward than them; reward being indeterministic in both their and mine case.

Now that we are in the second phase where we have already hired a bunch of folks, and formed a cohesive team where people are aware of each others' strengths and weaknesses, by blending slowly with each other, it is time to collaborate with each other and execute the plans we have had for months.

To repeat: in-fighting about money or LPs or anything will not get us anywhere. Even funding will not get us anywhere, it will only delay the death of PDH. What will keep us afloat is our ability to deliver real value to all stakeholders: our regulars, our contractors, our customers and our business partners.

The job of a business is not to survive while drinking the cool-aid of VC money, the job of a business is to be able to be so valuable that none of its stakeholders want it to die; so much so that they are willing to give up their money for it.

Expect 5L revenue by the end of November, thanks!
