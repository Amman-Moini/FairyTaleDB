This document represents a security which grants 9500 PDH LPs/month starting 24-Dec-2024, for 7 months totalling 66500 PDH LPs to Utkarsh Raj Srivastava, a loyal worker of PDH.

On 11th Nov evening, we did a free market bidding for this security, which was won by Utkarsh at the price of 62k LPs.

Mayank deducted 62k PDH LPs from Utkarsh immediately and Utkarsh is supposed to claim 9500 PDH LPs every month by reminding Mayank of this agreement, by sending him the Github link of this file on Whatsapp.

If Utkarsh reminds Mayank of this using any voice medium, Mayank reserves a right to deduct 20k LPs from Utkarsh. Mayank is anyway allowed to deduct any number of PDH LPs from anyone given he is the BDFL of PDH, but ye kisne bola tha ki PDH join karna compulsory hai? Utkarsh ko toh tabhi bhi free choice di gayi thi na?
