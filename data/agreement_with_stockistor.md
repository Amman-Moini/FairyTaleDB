Mayank will get the tech built for the current app plan for Stockistor by 10th December, failing which he will pay 2k INR to Balaji.

In the ideal case where Mayank is able to get the tech built by 10th Dec, Balaji will pay 6k INR to Mayank on 10th Jan, irrespective of what Stockistor is able to make.

This agreement was made in the PDH house between Mayank, Tanuj and Balaji on 21st Nov 1.37pm.

Tanuj has decided to stake 20k LPs for Stockistor. Mayank added this to Ritika's PDH LPs.
