Starting 10th Nov 2024, HarshitC's 600 LPs are being deducted/day. I am making it retroactively applicable from 1st Nov 2024. This is a temporary measure to throttle inflation of PDH which was +317/day.

HarshitC is allowed to come back and get it cancelled once PDH is in a better shape, from a financial perspective.
